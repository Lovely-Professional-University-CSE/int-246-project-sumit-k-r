Parkinson's Disease Classification

Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder that leads to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordination. Parkinson's symptoms usually begin gradually and get worse over time. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty walking and talking.

The following classification is done using three methods :
  1. Perceptron
  2. SVM using SVC
  3. LVQ using 1-nearest neighbour
